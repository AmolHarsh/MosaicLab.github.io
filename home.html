        <h2>Welcome to MOSAIC Lab</h2>
        <h3> Mobile Sensing and Ubiquitous Computing Laboratory</h3>
        <p>We are a data-driven research lab dedicated to advancing mobile and ubiquitous health sensing. Our mission is to develop innovative technologies to study complex health and behavioral outcomes in diverse populations. By leveraging cutting-edge signal processing, machine learning techniques, and novel sensing systems, we address real-world challenges in medicine and public health, aiming to bridge the gap between data science and healthcare for global health equity.</p>

        <p>At the University of California San Diego, the MOSAIC Lab designs on-body and off-body sensing systems to model health and behavioral outcomes. Our current research tackles pressing issues in substance use disorder and digital epidemiology, combining applied physics, advanced algorithms, and energy-efficient mobile computing to push the boundaries of health sensing technologies.</p>
