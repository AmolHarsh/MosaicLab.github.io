        <h2>Welcome to MOSAIC Lab @ UCSD</h2>
        <p>I direct the Laboratory for Mobile Sensing and Ubiquitous Computing at the University of California San Diego. Our current research focuses on the design and development of on-body and off-body sensing systems for modeling health and behavioral outcome measurements. Currently, we are exploring challenging problems in the application space of substance use disorder and digital epidemiology. For a detailed list of the recent and ongoing research projects, please visit the MOSAIC Lab website (link to be shared soon).</p>
        
        <p>Our current research is focused on solving problems in the domain of medicine and health sciences by developing novel mobile health sensing and wearable technologies. We challenge the physical mechanism of state-of-the-art health sensing technologies by bringing in novel or underexplored applied physics concepts, specialized signal processing and machine learning algorithms, and energy-efficient implementation in low-power mobile computing platforms.</p>
