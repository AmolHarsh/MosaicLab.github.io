        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>The MOSAIC Lab is dedicated to advancing mobile and ubiquitous computing to address challenges in health, behavioral science, and everyday interaction. Our research spans a variety of domains:</p>

        <h3>1. Mobile Health Sensing</h3>
        <p>We develop wearable and mobile systems to monitor health outcomes, including physiological and behavioral data. Our notable work includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpiTrack:</strong> A wearable-based tracker for opioid use utilizing temporal convolutional networks.</li>
            <li><strong>BodyBeat:</strong> A wearable system that captures non-speech body sounds for health monitoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Cognitive and Behavioral Health</h3>
        <p>We study the interaction between behavior, cognitive processes, and physiological signals to predict and analyze health outcomes. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>EarlyScreen:</strong> A multi-scale framework for predicting neural activation and psychopathology in preschool children.</li>
            <li><strong>Prefrontal Modulation:</strong> Research on frustration-related physiology in children with varying irritability levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Digital Biomarkers and Epidemiology</h3>
        <p>Our work in digital epidemiology focuses on identifying biomarkers for health trends and disease outbreaks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FluSense:</strong> A contactless syndromic surveillance system for hospital waiting areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Structured Prediction Energy Networks:</strong> Joint prediction of cocaine craving and euphoria.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Signal Processing and AI in Ubiquitous Computing</h3>
        <p>We leverage advanced signal processing and AI techniques to solve challenges in ubiquitous computing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Transfer Across Imaging Modalities:</strong> Enhancing mobile robot vision using adaptive autoencoders.</li>
            <li><strong>Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution:</strong> Improving imaging performance in arbitrary input-output band settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Interaction and Human-Centered Systems</h3>
        <p>We design interactive systems that seamlessly integrate with daily life, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calico:</strong> Relocatable wearables with precise locomotion tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>MechanoBeat:</strong> A system using harmonic oscillators and ultra-wideband radar for monitoring object interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Multidisciplinary Research</h3>
        <p>We tackle problems that intersect multiple disciplines, including sensor design, AI, and behavioral science:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nutrilyzer:</strong> A mobile system for characterizing liquid food using the photoacoustic effect.</li>
            <li><strong>NOSE:</strong> An odor sensing engine for ambient monitoring in kitchen environments.</li>
        </ul>
